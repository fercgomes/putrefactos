# PutrefactOS
This is a personal project that aims to build an operating system from scratch.
Its base comes from [cfenollosa/os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial). (the guy is a legend, cheers)
The rest should come along as he hopefully updates the repo and with concepts found in Silberschatz's *Operating System Concepts*.

## TODO:
- Do the fixes from section 24.
- Better shell
- Processes, threads
- Memory management
- User space, kernel space
